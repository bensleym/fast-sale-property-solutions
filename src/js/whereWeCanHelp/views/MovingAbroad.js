        <h1>Moving Abroad</h1>
        <p>
          What does time mean to you? Time is precious, time is something you
          can’t get back. Making the decision to move abroad is a big decision.
          It means making a new start at your dream destination. Once you’ve
          made that decision, why wait?{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The more time you wait is more time you can’t get back. You should be
          walking along the beach, decorating your new home or just enjoying and
          making the most of your new surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s the biggest thing holding you back? Your property! You’ll have
          to put it on the market to raise the funds to make the bold dream move
          abroad. And how are you going to do that? An estate agent?{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Selling your property through an estate agent is unpredictable.
          There’s no guarantee on time frames or even if your property will even
          sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the stress of having people coming to view your property,
          making sure your property is in the best possible condition it can be,
          and how easy is that to do with kids?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you sell through an estate agent you are exposed to all kinds of
          risks and can easily waste six months to a year dealing with their
          unreliable ways. Time is precious and so is your future.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the flip side, you may have already moved abroad, but your property
          back home is struggling to sell. Your now relying on an estate agent
          to keep you up to date on progress, checking day after day after day
          with the agent. Wasting precious time on phone calls and replying to
          emails, rather than living your dream life. Not to mention the calls
          to the solicitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people when moving abroad with a house back home only have
          limited funds to cover them while they wait for their property to
          sell. But two monthly mortgage payments soon eats in to pot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of enjoying your new life, you end up with sleepless nights
          stress about how the property back home is quickly eating away at
          funds. Worst of all, what happens if it doesn’t sell before the funds
          run out? The dream life rapidly comes to an end.
