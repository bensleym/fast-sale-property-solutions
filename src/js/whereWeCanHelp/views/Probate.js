          Inheriting a property isn’t always a straightforward process. Usually
          if you inherit a property you’ll need to sell it quickly before
          benefactors can reap the benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other issues with an inherited property is the fact that property may
          have been lived in for some time and have become dated or distressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem with a property that is dated or in distress is that the
          property will need updating before attracting any interest from
          buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Updating the property will need financing, not just that, you will
          also have to spend time finding reputable tradesmen and constantly
          monitor the project. This is a very time and cost consuming exercise.
          If there is more than one benefactor then the cost needs to be divided
          out, and for some this could be a burden they don’t need.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there’s more than one benefactor, you’ll find that some may need to
          release the cash in the property quicker than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selling through an estate agent when a property needs renovating is
          hard work. The property will sit ideal on the market due to the
          unrealistic asking price. Having expensive estate agents fees and
          dropping the price is very uneconomical.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you live miles away and aren’t able to monitor the property, whos
          going to keep an eye on it? Your property could become targeted by
          vandals or squatters. This would mean boarding up the property and
          what estate agent is going to spend time selling a boarded up
          property?
