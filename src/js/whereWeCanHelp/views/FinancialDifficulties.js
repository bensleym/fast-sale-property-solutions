          The crash in 2008 was down to the subprime mortgage market. Mortgages
          were being sold to people that they knowingly knew wouldn’t be able to
          pay the debt back. This lead to the collapse of a major investment
          bank and in turn lead to a global economic downturn.

          considered the risks you are exposing your family to? These a reason

          mortgage payments and any loans secured on it.” What happens if you
          become unemployed, interest rates rise or full ill and are unable to
          meet these repayments? Your home will be repossessed and leaving you

          obligation to pay your debt after 5 years, but you need to complete
          all the requirements of your bankruptcy case to be discharged.
