          Divorce is probably one of the worst situations to face. It can be a
          costly and lengthy process. Many issues arise from divorce, making
          arrangements for the kids, divide up your assets, find new
          accommodation and meetings with your solicitor. Having to find a buyer
          for your property is stressful at the best of times but even more
          stressful when you just want to move on with your lives.

          Using an estate agent is not only costly in price but costly in time.
          It&apos;s time you could be using to get on with your own lives. Most
          people end up having to pay a mortgage and rent while the property is
          up for sale. Most people can just about cover the mortgage let alone
          find the same amount to pay out in rent each month.
