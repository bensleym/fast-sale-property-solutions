          <p>
            Divorce is probably one of the worst situations to face. It can be a
            costly and lengthy process. Many issues arise from divorce, making
            arrangements for any children, dividing up your assets, finding new
            accommodation and meetings with your solicitor. Having to find a
            buyer for your property is stressful at the best of times but even
            more stressful when you just want to move on with your life.

            Using an estate agent is not only costly in price but costly in
            time. Itâ€™s time you could be using to move on with your own life.
            Most people end up having to pay a mortgage and rent while the
            property is up for sale. Most people can just about cover the
            mortgage let alone find the same amount to pay out in rent each
            month.
