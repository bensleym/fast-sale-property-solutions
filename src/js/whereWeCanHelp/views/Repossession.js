        <h1>Repossession</h1>
        <p>
          Repossession is one of the worst outcomes when having financial
          difficulties. With repossession at an all time high, don’t be the one
          to lose everything. You lose more than just your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being repossessed is more than just having your property taken from
          you. If you are repossessed your name will be added to the Possessions
          Register. All major credit agencies will be notified of your
          repossession and your credit rating will be adversely affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subsequently you’ll have problems with lenders lending to you and you
          may never qualify for a loan or mortgage again.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the past years of hard work building up your family home will be
          gone. You and your family will have to find new accommodation. So it’s
          in your best interest to stop repossession at all costs, it doesn’t
          just affect the present but the future as well.
        </p>
        <p>The basic court repossession process is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Summons for possession - A date and time is given for the hearing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The hearing - The usual outcome to this is a possession order which
            is usually up to two months.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bailiffs warrant - A 14 day notice will be issued and you could be
            forcibly removed from your home. The only way to stop this at this
            point is to immediately pay your arrears or in some cases the whole
            mortgage loan in full.
          </li>
        </ul>
