        <h1>Broken Chain</h1>
        <p>
          Losing your dream home due to the sale of your property falling
          through is a very common scenario. Being in a chain and having part of
          that chain break can be heartbreaking. There are multiple reasons for
          a chain to break:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Found a new home</li>
          <li>Moving abroad</li>
          <li>Relocation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the more urgent reason are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cash flow problems or worse bankruptcy</li>
          <li>Facing repossession</li>
          <li>Being made redundant / unemployed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the chain is dependant on you selling your property urgently, then
          selling through an estate agent can be time consuming but more
          importantly costly to your future.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          With estate agents you have too many uncertainties. The main one being
          how long will it take to sell your property. You may get an offer on
          your family home but that doesn’t mean that it’s a guaranteed sale.
          The buyer can still pull out for their own reasons. Most prospective
          buyers probably haven’t even filled in a form for a mortgage, so they
          are more than likely not in a position to proceed quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that the mortgage may get refused, but even if it is
          successful you then face the speed at which the conveyors and
          solicitors move, which lets face it anyone that isn’t a first time
          buyer will know it’s slow. It could be months before your home is
          sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          You get to the final stages of the process where you&apos;re about to
          complete and your buyer pulls out of the deal due to financial
          difficulties. What do you do now? Lose your dream house? Put your
          property back on the market and wait months again? Or take out an
          expensive bridging loan?
        </p>
        <p>
