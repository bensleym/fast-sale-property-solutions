          do this by using Lease Options.
        </p>
        <p>How do lease options work?</p>
        <p>
          You the seller needs to sell your home as quickly as possible to
          relieve the burden of paying the mortgage. The traditional way to do
          this is to use an estate agent. There are several issues you now face
          when using an estate agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The property market is oversupplied, which means your property could
          be on the market for a year, can you afford to keep paying your
          mortgage repayments every month for a year or even 6 months?
        </p>
        <p>
          The estate agent will advise you to keep dropping the price to
          generate more interest, which means again your losing out on the deal.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is where Lease Options come in. With a lease option we will take
          over your mortgage payments as well as the maintenance of your
          property. Once the price of your property has risen sufficiently we
          will then purchase the property.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paperwork can take as little as 7 days. Once the paperwork has
          been signed, you may immediately move out of the property and in turn
          you no longer have the financial burden of the property.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We will appoint an independent specialist solicitor to act on your
          behalf leaving you with no legal fees to pay.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply, we agree on the time period in which to fulfill this
          obligation. Until then, we have an option to buy your house at an
          agreed price but we will be paying your mortgage and maintaining your
          property to ensure the highest possible sale price.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in short, we “lease” the property from you by paying back your
          mortgage while maintaining all aspects of your property. Then you
          grant us an “option” to buy the property from you in the future. This,
          as you can see is a win/win solution and can instantly lift the burden
          of monthly mortgage repayments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you fall into one of these categories then a lease option is right
          for you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A lump sum of cash straight away is not required to move on.</li>
          <li>Your facing repossession or have mortgage arrears.</li>
          <li>
            You immediately need to move on without any further mortgage
            repayments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secure a price that is close to today&apos;s full market price no
            matter what the state of the housing market is in, in the future{" "}
          </li>
          <li>You have little or no equity in the property</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          How much does this service cost? Nothing! This is a free service and
          we cover all your legal fees. You could be mortgage free in just a few
          days. Lease options have a flexible nature so we can structure it to
          suit your circumstances.
